# Gun-Key-Point-Annotation-Tool
The Keypoint Annotation Tool is a versatile desktop application designed for annotating keypoints on images. Developed using PyQt5 and OpenCV, this tool is specifically optimized for creating skeleton-based annotations, such as annotating points of interest on guns (e.g., LMG, Rifle) or other structured objects.
